      "semiconductor and electronics companies to achieve better time- to-market, yields, quality, and operational efficiencies. \n",
      "Our strategy to achieve this is as follows: \n",
      "• Offer a Common, Flexible Platform for a Broad Group of Customers Across the Supply Chain . As semiconductor \n",
      "and electronics products are made with the efforts of equipment  manufacturers, front-end foundries, chip and \n",
      "system designers, design automation, intellectual property (“IP ”) providers, and OSATs, there is a need to analyze \n",

      "From 2000 through 2009, we expanded our technology footprint an d our operations in various countries through \n",
      "acquisitions. From 2009 to 2019, we primarily focused on the pe rvasive application of our technology to leading edge \n",

      "6 Industry Background \n",
      "Rapid technological innovation with increasingly shorter produc t life cycles has fueled th e economic growth of the \n",
      "semiconductor industry since the days of the PC revolution. IC companies have historically ramped production slowly, \n",
      "produced at high volume once a product gained market acceptance , and slowly reduced production volume when price \n",
      "and demand started to decrease near the end of the product’s li fe cycle. Today there are many  different business models \n",

      "volume with a relatively short lif e cycle, and products focused  on long term market segments like automotive and industrial \n",

      "on the level of design complexity and the maturity of the proce ss node used for product implementation. Processors, \n",
      "memory and field-programmable gate arrays (“FPGA”) continue to leverage the most advanced process nodes and \n",
      "experience significant challenges to achieve competitive initia l yields and optimized performance. Some products and \n",

      "among other things, on fast product yield ramp and the ability to optimize manufacturing and test metrics, such as yield \n",
      "reclamation, product quality, and test efficiency, throughout a  product’s life cycle. Thus, technologies or capabilities that \n",
